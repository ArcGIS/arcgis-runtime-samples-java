## How it works

To create a line of sight and update it with the mouse:

1. Create an `AnalysisOverlay` and add it to the scene view.
2. Create a `LocationLineOfSight` with initial observer and target locations and add it to the analysis overlay.
3. Make an `EventHandler<MouseEvent>` to capture mouse movement. Turn the screen point into a scene point with `sceneView.screenToLocationAsync(screenPoint)`.
4. Update the target location with `lineOfSight.setTargetLocation(scenePoint)`.
