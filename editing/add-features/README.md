# Add Features

Add new features to an online feature service.

A FeatureLayer created using this SeviceFeatutreTable that is applied to the ArcGISMap will display any new Features automatically.

## How to use the sample

Click on a location in the MapView to add a Feature at that location.

## How it works

To add a feature to a `ServiceFeatureTable` and update it's server with that `Feature`:

1. Create a service feature table from a URL, `new ServiceFeatureTable("URL")`.
2. Create a `FeatureLayer` from the service feature table, `new FeatureLayer(ServiceFeatureTable)`.
3. Create a feature with attributes and a location using service feature table, `ServiceFeatureTable.createFeature(attributes, location)`.
4. Apply the addition to the service feature table, `ServiceFeatureTable.addFeatureAsync(Feature)`.
5. Update the new feature to the server, `ServiceFeatureTable.applyEditsAsync()`.
