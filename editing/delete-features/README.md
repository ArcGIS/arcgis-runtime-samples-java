## How it works

To delete a `Feature` from a `ServiceFeatureTable`:

1. Create a service feature table from a URL.
2. Create a `FeatureLayer` from the service feature table.
3. Select features from the feature layer via `FeatureLayer.selectFeatures()`.
4. Remove the selected features from the ServiceFeatureTable using `ServiceFeatureTable.deleteFeaturesAsync()`.
5. Update the table on the server using `ServiceFeatureTable.applyEditsAsync()`.
