## How to use the sample

To update a feature's location.
 - click on a feature from the map and then click on another location to move it

## How it works

To get a `Feature` from a `ServiceFeatureTable` and change it's geometry:

1. Create a service feature table from a URL.
2. Create a `FeatureLayer` from the service feature table.
3. Select features from the feature layer, `FeatureLayer.selectFeatures`.
4. Change the selected feature's location using `Feature.setGeometry(Geometry)`.
5. After a change, update the table on the server using `ServiceFeatureTable.applyEditsAsync()`.
