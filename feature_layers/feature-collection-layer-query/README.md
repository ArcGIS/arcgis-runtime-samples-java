# Feature Collection Layer Query

Create a feature collection layer which shows the result of a SQL query from a service feature table.

## How it works

1. Create a `ServiceFeatureTable` object from a URL, and store it as a `FeatureTable` object.
2. Create a `QueryParameters` object and specify the where clause with `QueryParameters.setWhereClause()`.
3. Query the features stored in the feature table with `FeatureTable.queryFeaturesAsync(query)`.
4. Once complete, instantiate a `FeatureCollectionTable` with the results of the query from the `FeatureQueryResult` object.
5. Create a `FeatureCollection` object, and add the feature collection table to it.
6. Create a `FeatureCollectionLayer` object from the feature collection.
7. Display the layer by adding it to the map's operational layers with `mapView.getMap().getOperationalLayers().add(featureCollectionLayer)`.
