## How to use the sample

Use the buttons in the control panel to apply or reset definition expression.

## How it works

To limit the `Feature`s in your `FeatureLayer`:

1. Create a `ServiceFeatureTable` from a URL.
2. Create a feature layer from the service feature table.
3. Set the limit of the features on your feature layer using `FeatureLayer.setDefinitionExpression(Expression)`.
