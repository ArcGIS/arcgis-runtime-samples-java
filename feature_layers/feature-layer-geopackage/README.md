## How it works

To create a `FeatureLayer` from a local `GeoPackage`:

1. Create a `GeoPackage` passing the URI string into the constructor.
2. Load the `GeoPackage` with `GeoPackage.loadAsync`
3. When it's done loading, get the `GeoPackageFeatureTable`s inside with `geoPackage.getGeoPackageFeatureTables()`
4. For each feature table, create a feature layer with `FeatureLayer(featureTable)`. Add each to the map as an operational layer with `map.getOperationalLayers().add(featureLayer)`
