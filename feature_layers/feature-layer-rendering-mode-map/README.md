# Feature Layer Rendering Mode (Map)

Render features statically or dynamically.

## How it works

To change `FeatureLayer.RenderingMode` using `LoadSettings`:

1. Create a `ArcGISMap`.
2. Set preferred rendering mode to map, `mapBottom.getLoadSettings().setPreferredPointFeatureRenderingMode(FeatureLayer.RenderingMode.DYNAMIC)`.
    * Can set preferred rendering mode for `Points`, `Polylines`, or `Polygons`.
    * `Multipoint` preferred rendering mode is the same as point.
3. Set map to `MapView`, `mapViewBottom.setMap(mapBottom)`.
4. Create a `ServiceFeatureTable` from a point service, `new ServiceFeatureTable("http://sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Energy/Geology/FeatureServer/0");`.
5. Create `FeatureLayer` from table, `new FeatureLayer(poinServiceFeatureTable)`.
6. Add layer to map, `mapBottom.getOperationalLayers().add(pointFeatureLayer.copy())`
    * Now the point layer will be rendered dynamically to map view.
