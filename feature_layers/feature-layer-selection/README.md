## How to use the sample

Click on a feature from the map to select it.

## How it works

To select `Feature`s from your `FeatureLayer`:

1. Create a `ServiceFeatureTable` from a URL.
2. Create a feature layer from the service feature table.
3. Identify `MapView` on the location the user has clicked `MapView.identifyLayerAsync(featureLayer, clickLocation, tolerance, returnPopupsOnly, maxResults)`
4. Select all features that were identified with `FeatureLayer.selectFeatures(features)`.
