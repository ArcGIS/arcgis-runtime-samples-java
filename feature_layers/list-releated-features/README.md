## How to use the sample

After the layer is loaded, click on a feature to select it. An accordion view will display related features
grouped by feature table.

## How it works

To query related `Feature`s:

1. Get a `Feature` from a loaded `FeatureLayer`.
2. Get the feature's `FeatureTable` and call `featureTable.queryRelatedFeaturesAsync(feature)`.
3. You will get a list of `RelatedFeatureQueryResult`s.
    * You can get the name of the table containing the related features with `relatedFeatureQueryResult.getRelatedTable().getTableName()`.
4. The `RelatedFeatureQueryResult` implements `Iterable<Feature>`. You can iterate over the result to get the features:
    ```java
    for (Feature feature: relatedFeatureQueryResult) {
      //do something with the related feature...
     }
    ```
