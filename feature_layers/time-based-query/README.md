# Time Based Query

Filter features within a time range.

## How it works

To query features by a time extent:

1. Create a `ServiceFeatureTable` from the URL of a feature service.
2. Set the feature table's feature request mode to manual with `featureTable.setFeatureRequestMode(MANUAL_CACHE)`.
3. After loading the service feature table, create `QueryParameters`.
4. Create two `Calendar` objects with the beginning and ending timestamps and create a `TimeExtent` with them.
5. Set the time extent with `queryParameters.setTimeExtent(timeExtent)`
6. Populate the table with features in the time extent with `featureTable.popuateFromServiceAsync(queryParameters, true, outputFields)`.
    * The second argument is whether to clear the cache of features or not.
    * The output fields is a list of fields of the features to return. Use a list of one string `"*"` to get all of the fields.
7. Finally, create a feature layer from the feature table with `new FeatureLayer(featureTable)`, and add it to the map with `map.getOperationalLayers().add(featureLayer)` to see the features in the time extent.
