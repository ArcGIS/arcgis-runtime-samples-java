# Create Geometries

Create simple geometry types.

## How it works
To create different geometries and show them as graphics:

1. Use the constructors for the various simple `Geometry` types including `Point`, `Polyline`, `Multipoint`, `Polygon`, and `Envelope`. Geometries made of multiple points usually take a `PointCollection` as an argument.
2. To display the geometry, create a `Graphic` passing in the geometry, and a `Symbol` appropriate for the geometry type.
3. Add the `Graphic` to a `GraphicsOverlay` and add the overlay to the `MapView`.
