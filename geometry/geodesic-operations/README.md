# Geodesic Operations

Calculate the geodesic path and distance between two points.

## How to use the sample

Click on the map to select a path destination. The geodesic path between the two points will update.

## How it works

To create a geodesic path between two points:

1. Create a `Polyline` using two points.
2. Pass this polyline to: `GeometryEngine.densifyGeodetic(polyline, segmentLength, unitOfMeasurement, GeodeticCurveType.GEODESIC)`. This will create a new polyline with segments of length `segmentLength` and `LinearUnit` set to `unitOfMeasurement`. The curve will be geodesic.
3. You can set this geometry to a `Graphic` to display the curve in a `GraphicsOverlay`.
4. To get the distance, use `GeometryEngine.lengthGeodetic(pathGeometry, unitOfMeasurement, GeodeticCurveType.GEODESIC)`
