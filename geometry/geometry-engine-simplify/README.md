## How to use the sample

Click on the simplify button to apply the simplify geometry operation between the intersecting polygons. Click reset to restart the sample.

## How it works

To perform the simplify geometry operation on a `Polygon`:

1. Create a `GraphicsOverlay` and add it to the `MapView`.
2. Define the `PointCollection` of the `Geometry`.
3. Add the polygons to the GraphicsOverlay.
4. Determine the simplified geometry by using the `GeometryEngine.simplify(polygon.getGeometry())`.
