<h1>List Transformations By Suitability</h1>

<p>Find transformations to other spatial references suitable to the point's location.</p>

<p>Demonstrates how to use the TransformationCatalog to get a list of available DatumTransformations that
 can be used to project a Geometry between two different SpatialReferences.</p>

<p>Transformations (sometimes known as datum or geographic transformations) are used when projecting data from one 
spatial reference to another, when there is a difference in the underlying datum of the spatial references. 
Transformations can be mathematically defined by specific equations (equation-based transformations), or may rely on 
external supporting files (grid-based transformations). Choosing the most appropriate transformation for a situation 
can ensure the best possible accuracy for this operation. Some users familiar with transformations may wish to 
control which transformation is used in an operation.</p>

<h2>How to use the sample</h2>

<p>The list displays all suitable tranformations between the graphic and the map. Once the transform button is clicked a new red graphic will appear showing where the original graphic would be placed if transformation was applied.</p>

<p>Order by extent suitability, if checked, will find suitable transformations within the map's visible area. If not checked, will find suitable transformations using the whole map.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>To get suitable transformations from one spatial reference to another:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Use <code>TransformationCatalog.getTransformationsBySuitability(inputSR, outputSR)</code> for transformations 
    based on the map's spatial reference OR <code>TransformationCatalog.getTransformationsBySuitability(inputSR, 
    outputSR, mapView.getCurrentVisibileArea().getExtent())</code> for transformations suitable to the current extent
    .</li>
    <li>Pick one of the <code>DatumTransformation</code>s returned. Use <code>GeometryEngine.project(inputGeometry, 
    outputSR, datumTransformation)</code> to get the transformed geometry.</li>
</ol>
