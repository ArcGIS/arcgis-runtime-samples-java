# Spatial Operations

Find the union, difference, or intersection of two geometries.

## How to use the sample

The sample provides a drop down on the top, where you can select a geometry operation. When you choose a geometry operation, the application performs this operation between the overlapping polygons and applies the result to the geometries.

## How it works

To find the union, difference, intersection, or symmetric difference between `Polygon`s:

1. Create a `GraphicsOverlay` and add it to the `MapView`.
2. Define a `PointCollection` of each `Geometry`.
3. Add the overlapping polygons to the graphics overlay.
4. Determine spatial relationships between polygons, e.g. union, difference, etc, by using the appropriate operation `GeometryEngine.operation(polygon.getGeometry(), polygon.getGeometry())`
