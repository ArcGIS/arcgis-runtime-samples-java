# Spatial Relationships

Determine spatial relationships between two geometries.

## How to use the sample

Click on one of the three graphics to select it. The tree view will list the relationships the selected graphic has to the other graphic geometries.

## How it works

To check the relationship between geometries.

1. Get the geometry from two different graphics. In this example the geometry of the selected graphic is compared to the geometry of each graphic not selected.
2. Use the methods in `GeometryEngine` to check the relationship between the geometries, e.g. `contains`, `disjoint`, `intersects`, etc. If the method returns `true`, the relationship exists.
