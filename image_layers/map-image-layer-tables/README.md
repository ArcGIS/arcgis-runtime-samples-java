# Map Image Layer Tables

Find features in a spatial table related to features in a non-spatial table.

The non-spatial tables contained by a map service may contain additional information about sublayer features. Such information can be accessed by traversing table relationships defined in the service.

## How to use the sample

Once the map image layer loads, a list view will be populated with comment data from non-spatial features. Click on one of the comments to query related spatial features and display the first result on the map.

## How it works

To query a map image layer's tables and find related features:

1. Create an `ArcGISMapImageLayer` with the URL of a map image service.
2. Load the layer and get one of it's tables with `imageLayer.getTables().get(index)`.
3. To query the table, create `QueryParameters`. You can use `queryParameters.setWhereClause(sqlQuery)` to filter the features returned. Use `table.queryFeaturesAsync(parameters)` to get a `FeatureQueryResult`.
4. The `FeatureQueryResult` is an iterable, so simply loop through it to get each result `Feature`.
5. To query for related features, get the table's relationship info with `table.getLayerInfo().getRelationshipInfos()`. This returns a list of `RelationshipInfo`s. Choose which one to base your query on.
6. Now create `RelatedQueryParameters` passing in the `RelationshipInfo`. To query related features use `table.queryRelatedFeaturesAsync(feature, relatedQueryParameters)`.
7. This returns a list of `RelatedFeatureQueryResult`s, each containing a set of related features`.

## Additional information

You can use `ArcGISMapImageLayer.LoadTablesAndLayersAsync()` to recursively load all sublayers and tables
associated with a map image layer.
