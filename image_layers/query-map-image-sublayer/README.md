# Query Map Image Sublayer

Find features in a sublayer based on attributes and location.

Sublayers of an `ArcGISMapImageLayer` may expose a `ServiceFeatureTable` through a `Table` property. This allows you to perform the same queries available when working with a table from a `FeatureLayer`: attribute query, spatial query, statistics query, query for related features, and so on.

## How to use the sample

Specify a minimum population in the spinner and click the query button to query the sublayers. After a short time, the results for each sublayer will appear as graphics.

## How it works

To query map image sublayers:

1. Create an `ArcGISMapImageLayer` using the URL of it's image service.
2. After loading the layer, get its sublayers you want to query with `(ArcGISMapImageSublayer) layer.getSubLayers().get(index)`.
3. Load the sublayer, and then get its `ServiceFeatureTable` with `sublayer.getTable()`.
4. Create `QueryParameters`. You can use the where clause to query against a table attribute or set the parameters geometry to limit the results to an area of the map.
5. Call `sublayerTable.queryFeaturesAsync(queryParameters)` to get a `FeatureQueryResult` with features matching the query.
6. Iterate through the result features to use them however you wish.
