## How to use the sample

The data shown should refresh automatically every few seconds. A network message will be displayed when the dataset is loaded.

## How it works

To show KML with network links and display network messages:

1. Create a `KmlDataset` from a KML source which has network links.
2. Construct a `KmlLayer` with the dataset and add the layer as an operational layer.
3. To listen for network messages, add a `KmlNetworkLinkMessageReceivedListener` on the dataset.

## Relevant API
