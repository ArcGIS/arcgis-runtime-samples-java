# List KML Contents

Show KML nodes in their nested hierarchy.

## How to use the sample

When the scene and KML layer loads, the KML node tree will be shown in the tree view. Click on a node to zoom to its extent (if it has one).

## How it works

To list the nodes in a KML file:

1. Create a `KmlDataset` pointing to the KML file.
2. Start with a list of the rood nodes with `kmlDataset.getRootNodes()`.
3. For each node, check if it is a `KmlContainer` or `KmlNetworkLink`. These types can have child nodes. If it is one of these, cast to the appropriate type and call `getChildNodes()`.
4. Recursively search these child nodes for more nodes.
