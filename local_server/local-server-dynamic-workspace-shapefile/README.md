# Local Server Dynamic Workspace Shapefile

Dynamically add a local shapefile to a map using Local Server.

** Note: ** Local Server is not supported on MacOS

## How to use the sample

A Local Server will automatically start once application is running. Select a shapefile using the `Choose Shapefile` button which will automatically start a Local Map Service where a Dynamic Shapefile Workspace will be set and displayed to the Map View.

## How it works

To create a `ShapefileWorkspace` and add it to a `LocalMapService`:

1. Create and run a local server.
    * `LocalServer.INSTANCE` creates a local server
    * `Server.startAsync()` starts the server asynchronously
2. Create a LocalMapService instance using an empty .MPK file (the sample uses one that is created for you). Don't start it yet.
3. Create a ShapefileWorkspac. with id 'shp_wkspc' and absolute path to location of were shapefile is being stored.
4. Create a `TableSublayerSource` using `shapefileWorkspace.getId()` and name of shapefile with extension, example `mjrroads.shp`.
5. Add ShapefileWorkspace to `LocalMapService.setDynamicWorkspaces()`.
6. Start the LocalMapService
    * `localMapService.startAsync()`
    * `localMapService.addStatusChangedListener()` fires whenever the status of the local server has changed.
7. Wait for server to be in th. `LocalServerStatus.STARTED` state.
8. Create a `ArcGISMapImageLayer` using `localMapService.getUrl()`
9. Add the `ArcGISMapImageSublayer` to it's list of sublayers. The ArcGISMapImageSublayer points to the shapefile file on disk.
    * Once ArcGISMapImageLayer is done loading. set ArcGISMapImageSublayer to `ArcGISMapImageLayer.getSublayers()`. The ArcGISMapImageSublayer points to the shapefile file on disk.
