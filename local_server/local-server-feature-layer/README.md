# Local Server Feature Layer

Start a local feature service and display its features in a map.

**Note:** Local Server is not supported on MacOS

## How to use the sample

A Local Server and Local Feature Service will automatically be started and once running a Feature Layer will be created and added to the map.

## How it works

To create a `FeatureLayer` from a `LocalFeatureService`:

1. Create and run a local server.
    * `LocalServer.INSTANCE` creates a local server
    * `Server.startAsync()` starts the server asynchronously
2. Wait for server to be in th. `LocalServerStatus.STARTED` state.
    * `Server.addStatusChangedListener()` fires whenever the status of the local server has changed.
3. Create and run a local feature service.
    * `new LocalFeatureService(Url)`, creates a local feature service with the given url path to mpk file
    * `LocalFeatureService.startAsync()`, starts the service asynchronously
    * service will be added to the local server automatically
4. Wait for feature service to be in th. `LocalServerStatus.STARTED` state.
    * `LocalFeatureService.addStatusChangedListener()` fires whenever the status of the local service has changed.
5. Create a feature layer from local feature service.
    * create a `ServiceFeatureTable(Url)` from local feature service url, `LocalFeatureService.getUrl()`
    * load the table asynchronously, `ServiceFeatureTable.loadAsync()`
    * create feature layer from service feature table, `new FeatureLayer(ServiceFeatureTable)`
    * load the layer asynchronously, `FeatureLayer.loadAsync()`
6. Add feature layer to map, `Map.getOperationalLayers().add(FeatureLayer)`.
