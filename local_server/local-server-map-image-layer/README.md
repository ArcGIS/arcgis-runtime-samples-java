# Local Server map image layer

Start the Local Server and Local Map Service, create an ArcGIS Map Image Layer from the Local Map Service, and add it to a map.

## Use case

For executing offline geoprocessing tasks in your ArcGIS Runtime apps via an offline (local) server.

## How to use the sample

The Local Server and local map service will automatically be started and, once running, a map image layer will be created and added to the map.

## How it works

1. Create and run a local server with `LocalServer.INSTANCE`.
2. Start the server asynchronously with `Server.startAsync()`.
3. Wait for server to be in the  `LocalServerStatus.STARTED` state.
   * Callbacks attached to `Server.addStatusChangedListener()` will invoke whenever the status of the local server has changed.
4. Create and run a local service, example of running a `LocalMapService`.
    1. Instantiate `LocalMapService(Url)` to create a local map service with the given URL path to the map package (`mpk` file).
    2. Start the service asynchronously with `LocalFeatureService.startAsync()`. The service is added to the Local Server automatically.
5. Wait for the state of the map service to be `LocalServerStatus.STARTED`.
   * Callbacks attached to `LocalFeatureService.addStatusChangedListener()` will invoke whenever the status of the local service has changed.
6. Create an ArcGIS map image layer from local map service.
   1. Create a `ArcGISMapImageLayer(Url)` from local map service url provided by `LocalMapService.getUrl()`.
   2. Add the layer to the map's operational layers.
   3. Connect to the map image layer's `LoadStatusChanged` signal.
   4. When the layer's status is `Loaded`, set the map view's extent to the layer's full extent.
