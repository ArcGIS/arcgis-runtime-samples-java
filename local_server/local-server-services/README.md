## How to use the sample

Choose an option from the dropdown control to filter packages by service type. Then click the Open button to choose a package. Finally, click the Start button to start the service. The service's status will be displayed in the center log.

To stop a service, select it from the Running Services list and click the Stop Service button. To go to the service's URL in your default web browser, select it and click the Go to URL button.

## How it works

To start a `LocalService`:

1. Start the local server.
    * `LocalServer.INSTANCE` creates a local server
    * `server.startAsync()` starts the server asynchronously
2. Wait for server to be in th. `LocalServerStatus.STARTED` state.
    * `Server.addStatusChangedListener()` fires whenever the running status of the local server
changes
3. Create and run a local service.
    * `new LocalMapService(Url)` creates a local map service with the given url path to mpk file
    * `service.startAsync()` starts the service asynchronously
4. Stop the service with `service.stopAsync().`
