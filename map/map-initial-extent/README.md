## How to use the sample

As application is loading, initial view point is set and map view zooms to that location.

## How it works

To set an initial `Viewpoint`:

1. Create an `ArcGISMap`.
2. Create a view point using an `Envelope`, `Viewpoint(Envelope)`.
3. Set the starting location of the ArcGIS map, `ArcGISMap.setInitialViewpoint(Viewpoint)`.
4. Set the ArcGIS map to the `MapView`.
