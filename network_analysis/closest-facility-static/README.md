# Closest Facility (Static)

Find routes from several locations to the respective closest facility.

## Use case

Quickly and accurately determining the most efficient route between a location and a facility is a frequently encountered task (e.g. emergency services).

## How to use the sample

Click the 'Solve Routes' button to determine and display the route from each incident (fire) to the nearest facility (fire station).

## How it works

To display a `ClosestFacilityRoute` between several incidents and facilities:

1. Create a `ClosestFacilityTask` using a Url from an online service.
2. Get the default set of `ClosestFacilityParameters` from the task: `closestFacilityTask.createDefaultParametersAsync().get()`.
3. Build a list of all Facilities and Incidents:
    * Create a `FeatureTable` using `ServiceFeatureTable(Uri)`.
    * Query the `FeatureTable` for all `Feature`s using `.queryFeaturesAsync(queryParameters)`.
    * Iterate over the result and add each `Feature` to a `List`, instantiating the feature as a `Facility` or `Incident`.
4. Add a list of all facilities to the task parameters: `closestFacilityParameters.setFacilities(facilitiesList)`.
5. Add a list of all incidents to the task parameters: `closestFacilityParameters.setIncidents(incidentsList)`.
6. Get `ClosestFacilityResult` from solving the task with the provided parameters: `closestFacilityTask.solveClosestFacilityAsync(closestFacilityParameters)`.
7. Find the closest facility for each incident by iterating over the previously created `incidentsList`:
    * Get index list of closet facilities to the incident, `closestFacilityResult.getRankedFacilityIndexes(indexOfIncident).get(0)`.
    * Find closest facility route, `closestFacilityResult.getRoute(closestFacilityIndex, indexOfIncident)`.
8. Display the route:
    * create a `Graphic` from route geometry, with `new Graphic(closestFacilityRoute.getRouteGeometry())`.
    * add graphic to `GraphicsOverlay` and set it to the mapview.
