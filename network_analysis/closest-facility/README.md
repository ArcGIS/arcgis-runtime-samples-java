## How to use sample

Left click near any of the hospitals and a route will be displayed from that clicked location to the nearest hospital.

## How it works

To display a `ClosestFacilityRoute` between an `Incident` and a `Facility`:

1. Create a `ClosestFacilityTask` usin. an Url from an online service.
2. Get `ClosestFacilityParameters` from task, `task.createDefaultParametersAsync().get()`
3. Add facilities to parameters, `closestFacilityParameters.setFacilities().addAll(facilities)`.
4. Add incidents to parameters, `closestFacilityParameters.setIncidents().add(Arrays.asList(new Incident(incidentPoint)))`.
5. Get `ClosestFacilityResult` from solving task with parameters, `task.solveClosestFacilityAsync(facilityParameters).get()`
6. Get index list of closet facilities to incident, `facilityResult.getRankedFacilities(0)`
7. Get index of closest facility, `rankedFacilitiesList.get(0)`
8. Find closest facility route, `facilityResult.getRoute(closestFacilityIndex, IncidentIndex)`
9. Display route to `MapView`.
    * create `Graphic` from route geometry, `new Graphic(route.getRouteGeometry())`
    * add graphic to `GraphicsOverlay` which is attached to the mapview
