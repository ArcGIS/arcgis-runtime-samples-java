# Service Area Task

Find the service area for a point.

A service area shows locations that can be reached from a facility based off a certain impedance [such as travel time]. Barriers can also be added which can effect the impedance by not letting traffic through or adding the time is takes to pass that barrier.

## How to use sample

1. In order to find any service areas at least one ServiceAreaFaciltiy needs to be added.
2. To add a facility, click the facility button, then click anywhere on the MapView.
3. To add a barrier, click the barrier button, and click multiple locations on MapView.
    * Hit the barrier button again to finish drawing barrier.
    * Hitting any other button will also stop the barrier from drawing.
4. To show service areas around facilities that were added, click show service areas button.
5. Reset button, clears all graphics and reset ServiceAreaTask.

## How it works

To display service areas around a certain location:

1. Create a `ServiceAreaTask` from an online service.
2. Get ServiceAreaParameters from task, `task.createDefaultParametersAsync()`
3. Setting return polygons to true will return all services areas, `serviceAreaParameters.setReturnPolygons(true)`
4. Add a `ServiceAreaFacilty` to parameters, `serviceAreaParameters.setFacilities(serviceAreaFacility)`
5. Get `ServiceAreaResult` by solving the service area task using parameters, `task.solveServiceAreaAsync(serviceAreaParameters).get()`
6. Get any `ServiceAreaPolygon`s that were returned, `serviceAreaResult.getResultPolygons(facilityIndex)`
    * facilityIndex is the faciltiy from the mapview that you want to get the services areas of
7. Display services areas to MapView, `graphicsOverlay.getGraphics().add(new Graphic(serviceAreaPolygon.getGeometry(), fillSymbol))`
