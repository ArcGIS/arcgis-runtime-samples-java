# Load WFS with XML query

Load a WFS feature table using an XML query.

## Use case

ArcGIS Runtime `QueryParameters` objects can't represent all possible queries that can be made against a WFS feature service. For example, Runtime query parameters don't support wildcard searches. However, queries can be provided as raw XML strings, allowing access to query functionality not available with `QueryParameters`.

## How it works

1. Create a `WfsFeatureTable` with a URL.
2. Set the feature table's axis order to `NO_SWAP`, and the feature request mode to `MANUAL_CACHE`.
3. Create a `FeatureLayer` from the feature table and add it to the map's operational layers.
4. Call `populateFromServiceAsync` on the feature table to populate it with only those features returned by the XML query.

## About the data

This service shows trees in downtown Seattle and the surrounding area. An XML-encoded `GetFeature` request is used to limit results to only trees of the genus *Tilia*.
