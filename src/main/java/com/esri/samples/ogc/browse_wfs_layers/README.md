<h1>Browse WFS layers</h1>

<p>Browse a WFS service for layers and add them to the map.</p>

<p><img src="BrowseWfsLayers.png"/></p>

<h2>Use case</h2>

<p>Services often have multiple layers available for display. For example, a feature service for a city might have layers representing roads, land masses, building footprints, parks, and facilities. A user can choose to only show the road network and parks for a park accessibility analysis. </p>

<h2>How to use the sample</h2>

<p>A list of layers in the WFS service will be shown. Select a layer to display it.</p>

<p>Some WFS services return coordinates in X,Y order, while others return coordinates in lat/long (Y,X) order. If you don't see features rendered or you see features in the wrong location, use the checkbox to swap the coordinate order and reload. Note: the WFS service in this sample does not require coordinate swapping.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a <code>WfsService</code> object with a URL to a WFS feature service.</li>

<li>Obtain a list of <code>WfsLayerInfo</code> from the WFS service with <code>getServiceInfo().getLayerInfos()</code>.</li>

<li>Create a <code>WfsFeatureTable</code> from the <code>WfsLayerInfo</code>.

<ul>
<li>Set the axis order of the table if necessary.</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Create a <code>FeatureLayer</code> from the WSF feature table.</li>

<li>Add the feature layer to the map.

<ul>
<li>The sample uses randomly-generated symbology, similar to the behavior in ArcGIS Pro.</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
